# Year1-LabWork
This repository contains my C and C++ lab assignments and mini-projects from my first year of university. 
The goal of this repo is to demonstrate my progress in programming fundamentals, problem-solving.

# Contents

## Semester I:
- Contains simple problems with medium complexity. A mix-mash of C and C++, and is the foundation for my later work in the second Semester.
- Topics covered: Data Types, Strings, Arrays, Vectors, Functions, File I/O, Dynamic Memory Allocation(Malloc), Simple Algorithms, etc.
- Includes a simple project: a Basic Calculator that works with both integers and float.

## Semester II:

-  Contains C++ assignments of medium complexity that are built on OOP Principles.
-  Topics covered: organizing data into classes, it's encapsulation, relations between classes, inheritance and aggregation, Rule of 0/3/5, The Deathly Diamond of Death,  Standard Library Template. 

## 🧑‍💻 Notes
All code was written as part of coursework in the [Faculty of Applied Sciences of Politehnica Bucharest](http://fsa.pub.ro/), and later cleaned up and commented for clarity.
